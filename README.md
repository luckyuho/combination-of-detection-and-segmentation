The following website is my abstract in [ION/IEEE-PLANS](https://www.ion.org/plans/abstracts.cfm?paperID=5895)

Our network is based on [SSD7](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras)
here is our original network structure


Pictures below are our camera input images(left) and predictions(right)

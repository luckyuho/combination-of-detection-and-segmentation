# Combination of Computer Vision Detection and Segmentation for Autonomous Driving

The following website is my abstract in [ION/IEEE-PLANS](https://www.ion.org/plans/abstracts.cfm?paperID=5895)

We use [unity](https://unity3d.com/) as our simulation environment

Our network is based on [SSD7](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras)
here is our original network structure

Some instruction shows in [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/luckyuho/combination-of-detection-and-segmentation/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
and after [PLANS](https://www.ion.org/plans/program.cfm) conference we will provide our source code

Pictures below are our camera input images(left) and predictions(right)
where yellow: road, green: people, blue: car
